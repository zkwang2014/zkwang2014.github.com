This is a blog about my experiences of study. I am currently a second year graduate student at University of Florida Department of Biostatistics [M.S. in Biostatistics](http://biostat.ufl.edu/education/ms-in-biostatistics/) program.

The Chinese version of this Blog is on [WordPress](https://zkwang2014.wordpress.com/). But it may not be up-to-date since I don't not use it very often. 

To get instant connection with me, you can find me on [Weibo](http://weibo.com/zkwang2014) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/zkwang2014), or email me at <zkwang2014@gmail.com>, or leave a message under any post of this blog (there are english and chinese comment systems).
