This is a blog about my experiences of study in Statistics. I am currently a second year graduate student at University of Florida Department of Biostatistics [M.S. in Biostatistics](http://biostat.ufl.edu/education/ms-in-biostatistics/) program and expected to graduate in 2016.

The Chinese version of this Blog is on [WordPress](https://zkwang2014.wordpress.com/). But it may not be up-to-date since I don't not use it very often.
