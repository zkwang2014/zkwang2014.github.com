You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight r %}
permutest.r
function () 
{
out<-numeric(1000)
for (i in 1:1000){
X<-sample(sim1.out$Y,replace=F)
T<-sim1.out$T
dfr<-data.frame(cbind(X,T))
pomodi<-polr(factor(X)~T,data=dfr)
sp<-summary(pomodi)
out[i]<-(sp$coef[1,1]-1)/sp$coef[1,2]
}
out
}
# Assume that we are fitting a multiple linear regression
# on the MTCARS data
library(car)
fit <- lm(mpg~disp+hp+wt+drat, data=mtcars)
# Influential Observations
# added variable plots 
av.Plots(fit)
# Cook's D plot
# identify D values > 4/(n-k-1) 
cutoff <- 4/((nrow(mtcars)-length(fit$coefficients)-2)) 
plot(fit, which=4, cook.levels=cutoff)
# Influence Plot 
influencePlot(fit,	id.method="identify", main="Influence Plot", sub="Circle size is proportial to Cook's Distance" )

{% endhighlight %}
